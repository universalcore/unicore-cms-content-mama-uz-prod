Make sure there are no small objects which could choke him, such as coins, within his reach. Put away sharp objects, such as knives, scissors and pens, and anything that is not safe to eat or drink.\r\n\r\n - Check that nothing can fall on your baby. Make sure everything is secure. Any electrical wires or other rope or cords should be rolled up safely and out of his way!\r\n\r\n - Keep your baby away from fire and water. Your baby wants to explore; he may touch flames and burn himself. Make sure he cannot touch anything hot when you are cooking. Keep him away from large containers of water. Keep them covered with tight-fitting lids on top, so he does not fall in.\r\n\r\nRemember, when your baby starts to walk and stand, he may want to climb! Take care that dangerous objects and wires are out of his reach, and watch him to make sure he cannot fall off chairs and tables.\r\n",
