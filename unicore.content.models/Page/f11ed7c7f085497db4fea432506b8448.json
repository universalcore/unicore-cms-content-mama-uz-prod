  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is important to rest after losing a pregnancy (miscarriage or termination). Try not to do any hard work until the bleeding stops.\r\n\r\nYour body needs time to heal. You will bleed for a while. You may also have something that feels like period pain. Do not have sex until the bleeding has stopped, to protect your womb from germs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ask your family for help. They could help you with household tasks or care for your other children, if you have them. \r\n\r\nYour breasts may leak and they could swell. This can be upsetting. You could wear a supportive cloth or bra. Put clean pieces of cloth in it to soak up leaks. Do not squeeze out the milk. It will go away slowly by itself over a few weeks.\r\n\r\nRight now, your body needs rest and care. Try to eat well, with lots of fruit, vegetables, eggs, beans, fish or meat. If you take iron and folic acid tablets, carry on. They will help too.\r\n\t\r\nFor now, use family planning. By waiting until your body has recovered before you try for another baby, you will be giving yourself the best chance for a healthy pregnancy in the future.\r\n\r\n**Warning signs after pregnancy loss**\r\n\r\nIf the pain gets worse or you soak a pad in an hour, see a health worker immediately. \r\n\r\nAlso see a health worker if you have:\r\n\r\n - Sticky, smelly fluid coming from your vagina\r\n - A fever\r\n - Faintness\r\n - A pain in your shoulders\r\n - Painful, red areas on your breasts\r\n - Bleeding that will not stop.\r\n",
