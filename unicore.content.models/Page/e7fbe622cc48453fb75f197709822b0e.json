It will mean fewer problems if you get the right care early on.\r\n\r\nYou can have tests to make sure that you and your baby are healthy. You can have blood and urine (pee) tests, and tests for HIV. \r\n\r\nIf you know you are living with HIV, you can get free medication to prevent your baby from becoming HIV+. \r\n\r\nEven if you feel well, get regular check-ups so that you and your baby can stay healthy.\r\n",
