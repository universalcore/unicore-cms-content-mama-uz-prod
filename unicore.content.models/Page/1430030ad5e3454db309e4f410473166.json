  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nYour baby is growing inside your body just above your bladder (where your pee collects before you pass it). The weight of the baby tends to squash the bladder, which makes you need to pee (called urine) more often. This is common in pregnancy. Do not cut down the amount of clean, safe water you drink. You need it to stay healthy.\r\n\r\nIf you find that it is painful when you pass pee, you might have an infection. This can give you a high temperature, or make you suddenly feel hot and cold. Other signs of infection are blood in your urine, feeling sick, and shaking. Sex might be painful, too.\r\n\r\nGetting treated is very important, so go to the clinic. The germs in your urine can give you a kidney infection, which can be serious for your and your baby\u2019s health.\r\n\r\nYou can also help to prevent urine infections.\r\n\r\n - After going to the toilet, always wipe from 'front' to 'back', or pour water from front to back, or wash with soap.\r\n - Drink lots of clean, safe water. This will help to wash out infections.\r\n - If you need to pee, go! Do not hold it in.\r\n - Always pee after sex, if you can, to get rid of any germs.\r\n",
