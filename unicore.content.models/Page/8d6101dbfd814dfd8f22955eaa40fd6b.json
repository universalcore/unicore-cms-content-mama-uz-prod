  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is good, and reassuring, to have health check-ups in the weeks after your baby is born, to make sure both you and your baby are OK. Remember, boys and girls need the same amount of check-ups.\r\n\r\nVisit the health worker with your baby at least once during week 1 (ideally when he is 3 days old) and again when she is 6 weeks old. \r\n\r\nTake your baby to the clinic immediately if:\r\n\r\n - Her tummy is too cold or too hot\r\n - She develops yellow eyes, hands and feet within the first day of his life\r\n - She refuses to feed or sucks poorly\r\n - She will not stop crying or if her cry sounds unusual\r\n - She has a fit, is drowsy and not moving much, or has bluish skin or nails\r\n - She is wheezing, grunting, or breathing quickly \r\n - She is vomiting after every feed for more than a day, or has a swollen tummy\r\n - The area around your baby's cord stump is red or smelly\r\n\r\nThese are signs that your baby is unwell, and needs treatment quickly.\r\n",
