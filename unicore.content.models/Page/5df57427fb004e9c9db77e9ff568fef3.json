But he also still needs breastmilk.\r\n\r\nAs he grows older, he will need more food and a greater variety of food. But babies can be fussy eaters, and they can lose interest in food easily.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips to make sure your baby eats well:\r\n\r\n - Feed him lots of tasty foods. Take your time. Sit and talk to him while he eats. Eating is a new skill for him, and he is learning.\r\n - If your baby refuses to eat, be patient. Do not force him. Do not give him sugar, or unhealthy foods. They have no goodness, and are bad for your baby. \r\n - Give him lots of colours, tastes and textures. As babies grow, their tastes change often. What your baby may hate now, he may love in a few weeks!\r\n - Make mealtimes fun. Make sure he is comfortable and that mealtimes are enjoyable for you both.\r\n - Make eye contact, smile and talk to him. Let his meals be a social time. It will help him to eat, and it will also help him learn social skills and new words.\r\n\r\nIf your baby is easily distracted while eating, take him to a quiet place and gently encourage him to eat.\r\n",
