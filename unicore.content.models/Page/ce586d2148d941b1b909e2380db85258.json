The surest sign is a missed period, but you may find it hard to remember the date of your last period.\r\n\r\nDo you have any of these signs of pregnancy?\r\n\r\n - Your breasts look and feel different \r\n - You notice some spots of blood in your underwear \r\n - You feel like you want to throw up\r\n - You need to pee more than usual \r\n - You miss a period\r\n\r\nIf you think you are pregnant, it is best if you go to the clinic. The earlier you find out, the sooner you can start planning for your new baby. At the clinic, you can get advice and help while you are pregnant.\r\n\r\nYou will be weighed, your blood pressure will be checked and your pee (urine) will be tested. \r\n\r\nWorried about going to the clinic? Ask a friend to go with you.\r\n",
